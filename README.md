#📘 Game Development Fundamentals – Gamelab Indonesia



#### 📌 Overview

A collection of **~11 mini-projects** created during the Game Development Fundamentals program at Gamelab Indonesia.
Each project introduces **one essential game mechanic** used in real game development workflows.

This course helped me understand:

* Player control systems
* Input interactions (keyboard + mouse)
* Camera & target mechanics
* Simple UI and event logic
* Basic game object behaviors
* Smooth workflow and engine fundamentals

#### 🎯 What’s Inside

Each folder represents **one mechanic-focused prototype**, built using **Construct 2/3** as one of my earliest gamedev tools.

Example mechanics included:

* 🔄 Mouse-aim rotation (e.g. Tank turret facing cursor)
* 🎯 Shooting system basics
* 🎮 Player movement fundamentals
* ⚠️ Simple collision rules
* ⭐ Trigger-based feedback & scoring
* 🧭 Level boundaries and respawn logic

#### 🚀 Goal of This Course

To build a **strong foundation** before moving into engines like Unity, Phaser, and Three.js.

This marks the starting point of my gamedev journey —
learning **one mechanic at a time** and turning those fundamentals into real games later.
