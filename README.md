#📘 Gamelab – Game Fundamentals Projects

Learning the Core of Game Development using Construct

This repository contains a collection of game development exercises assigned by Gamelab Indonesia as the foundational stage of my game developer journey.
These projects were created to introduce essential concepts such as gameplay mechanics, asset management, event systems, and publishing workflows.


🎯 Course Objective
✔ Understand basic game design and structure
✔ Create interactive elements using Construct
✔ Learn scene/level setup
✔ Apply collisions, triggers, variables, and win/lose conditions
✔ Build simple but complete playable prototypes

Each project focuses on one or more fundamental mechanics — progressing from the basics to more robust game logic.
