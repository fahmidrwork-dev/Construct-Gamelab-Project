# 🎯 Game Development Fundamentals — Construct 3

This repository contains all the hands-on projects I created during my **Game Development Internship**  
at **Educa Studio — Gamelab Indonesia** 🎮

Through this program, I learned the essential building blocks of game development using **Construct 3**,  
starting from simple interactions and progressing into full gameplay systems and level design.

## 🎓 What I Learned

Throughout these projects, I developed a strong foundation in:
- Designing gameplay mechanics step-by-step
- Structuring events and conditions to control game logic
- Creating win/lose states and level progression
- Implementing player feedback (audio/visual)
- Debugging gameplay behavior and improving design choices
- Turning small ideas into functional mini-games

## 🏁 Final Project Highlight — **Mini Platformer Game**

My proudest build in this course.  
Features include:
- 3-HP player system
- Animated enemies & player
- Collectible gems
- Level layout with obstacles
- Game-over and win logic

This project was a major milestone — applying everything I learned from the earlier exercises into one cohesive game.
